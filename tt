Today is my last day at Admiral India, and honestly, I’m still wondering how fast the time went by. It’s been a packed journey with a lot of learning, a lot of challenges, and a lot of good memories.
First, a big thank you to Rob, Ganga, and Tara for the continuous support throughout my time here. You three have been solid pillars for me, and I genuinely appreciate everything you’ve done.
A special thanks to Tara for giving me the chance to be part of the AI community. That opportunity opened doors to work with incredibly smart people, learn from teams beyond my own, and look at testing through a completely new lens. Tara, you’ve been the driving force behind that entire initiative, and your support has meant a lot. Thank you for backing me throughout.
I’d also like to thank Arun, the first person who gave me the opportunity to join Admiral. Even though we didn’t get to work closely, your trust and encouragement at the start really mattered.
I’m moving on due to personal priorities, but I’m leaving with a lot of great relationships and a ton of support that I received from all of you—inside and outside the team. I’ve learned a lot here, and I’ll carry that forward.
Thank you once again for everything.
Let’s definitely stay in touch.
