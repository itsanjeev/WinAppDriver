Modernized Page Object Model Without PageFactory
Proposed Solution:
Transition from PageFactory to a modernized Page Object Model that eliminates its limitations by adopting custom practices for element initialization and locator management.
1. Replace @FindBy with Custom Getter Methods
Use custom methods to locate elements dynamically when needed. This provides more flexibility, especially for dynamic locators, and avoids the static nature of @FindBy.
Example:
public WebElement getElementByXPath(String dynamicXPath) {
    return driver.findElement(By.xpath(dynamicXPath));
}

// Usage in tests:
WebElement dynamicElement = page.getElementByXPath("//table/tr[1]/td[2]");
Advantages:
Reduces tight coupling of locators with code.
Supports dynamic locators for changing web elements.
Improves maintainability by centralizing locator logic.
2. Implement Lazy Initialization for Web Elements
Use lazy-loading techniques to initialize elements only when they are accessed in the test execution, improving performance.
Example with Lazy Initialization:
private WebElement button;

public WebElement getButton() {
    if (button == null) {
        button = driver.findElement(By.id("button-id"));
    }
    return button;
}

// Usage in tests:
page.getButton().click();
Advantages:
Avoids unnecessary loading of unused elements.
Reduces memory usage for large, complex pages.
3. Integrate Explicit Waits for Robust Element Handling
Replace static element initialization with dynamic waits to handle elements that may take time to load.
Example with Explicit Waits:
public WebElement getDynamicElement(String cssSelector) {
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
    return wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(cssSelector)));
}

// Usage:
WebElement element = page.getDynamicElement(".dynamic-class");
Advantages:
Improves test stability by ensuring elements are interactable before actions are performed.
Eliminates flaky tests caused by timing issues.
4. Use Constructor-Based Dependency Injection
Pass the WebDriver instance through constructors to ensure objects are initialized properly.
Example:
public class LoginPage {
    private WebDriver driver;

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public WebElement getUsernameField() {
        return driver.findElement(By.id("username"));
    }
}
Advantages:
Eliminates reliance on PageFactory.initElements.
Encourages cleaner, modular, and testable code.
5. Centralize Locators Using Constants or Enums
Store locators in a centralized place for better maintainability and reusability.
Example:
public static final String LOGIN_BUTTON = "//button[@id='login']";

public WebElement getLoginButton() {
    return driver.findElement(By.xpath(LOGIN_BUTTON));
}
Advantages:
Simplifies updates to locators.
Provides better organization and reduces duplication.
Expected Outcomes:
Improved Performance: Elements are initialized only when needed, reducing resource overhead.
Increased Maintainability: Locators are centralized, and the codebase is modular and flexible.
Better Test Stability: Explicit waits and dynamic locators reduce flaky tests.
Future-Proof Framework: Avoiding PageFactory aligns with modern Selenium practices and ensures compatibility with future updates.
This modernized approach will make your automation framework more scalable, robust, and easier to maintain. Would you like additional examples or refinements?
